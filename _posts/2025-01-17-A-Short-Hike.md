## Why is it worth your time?

_A Short Hike_ is a fun, chill little game where you play a penguin who is on a quest for cell reception. Unfortunately, the best way to get it is to climb Hawk Peak, a steep and tiring climb.  
  
The controls for this game are straightforward and the tutorial is given in bite-sized pieces as you need to use new mechanics. Personally, I love when games lead you through the tutorial rather than info-dumping everything at the beginning.  
  
Running around the island, it’s immediately obvious that you have full, creative freedom to head in any direction you want. Your end goal may be to get to the peak, but there’s no time limit on achieving that.  
  
As you journey through the trails, you’ll meet other animals who may have benign things to say, or who may ask for things. You’ll learn early on that you need golden feathers to get to the top of the mountain, these feathers are a physical representation of your stamina. As it stands, this is the single requirement to getting to the top of the peak and you don’t even have to find all of them.  
  
Golden Feathers can be obtained in a myriad of ways by either buying them from people or finding them hidden around the island. There are a few different items lying around to snatch up, so you’ll already be rooting around for coins and chests hidden about.  
  
Not only does this game encourage exploration, but it has a few ways that you can race if that’s something you’re into, namely foot racing and boat racing.  
  
Speaking of boats, there are a few hidden islands out in the ocean that you can explore, so don’t limit yourself to just land alone.  
  
Whether it’s fishing, racing, collecting, gliding, questing, or just generally exploring, _A Short Hike_ has what you want.


## Sound design.

The music is serene enough that it doesn’t overtake the game and the sound design was nice for all the atmospheric noises. There was a bit of _Animal Crossing_ whimsy in how the voices sounded and I could see a bit of that inspiration whether it was intended or not.  
  
The art style is exceedingly charming, I loved the fact that it was an island populated by animals. Each character’s design made them recognizably different and the stage design was easily one of the best parts of the game.  
  
The different areas of the island helped to flesh out the ecology of _A Short Hike_.

## Cozy factor

If you’re looking for cozy, then you want to give _A Short Hike_ a try. It was instant cozy vibes on this one.  
  
There seems to be a little bit of something for everyone. Whether you like exploring, questing, or just sitting and fishing, _A Short Hike_ has all of it.  
  
I had the most fun just running around and trying to find all the coins and shells that I could, even after I finished the request of finding 15 shells. I still don’t know what the sticks are for, but I hoarded those too.
